- `GET /Book/getbooks` - Get all books (Authenticated)

### Category Management
- `POST /Category/addCategory` - Add a new category (Authenticated)
- `GET /Category/getCategories` - Get all categories (Authenticated)

### File Management

## Security Implementation

### JWT Authentication Flow
1. Client sends credentials to `/auth/authenticate`
2. Server validates credentials and returns JWT token
3. Client includes token in `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header
4. Server validates token on each request

### Security Components
- **JwtAuthenticationFilter**: Validates JWT tokens on each request
- **JwtService**: Handles token generation, validation, and extraction
- **AppConfig**: Configures authentication provider and password encoder
- **SecurityConfiguration**: Defines security rules and CORS policy

### Roles
- **ADMIN**: Full access including user role management
- **CLIENT**: Regular user with limited downloads
- **CLIENTA**: Subscriber user with extended privileges
